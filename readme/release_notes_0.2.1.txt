Release 0.2 added Money. The name of the module has been changed to TimeAndMoneyLibrary.

This version of this code is intended for use on projects who are interested
in helping the development of the library and are prepared to deal with the
immaturity of the code and design. Not only will defects in the code be fixed 
in later versions, there will be radical changes to the design, based on the
feedback of these early users. These design changes will not all be backward
compatible.

With that caveat, the library in its current state should provide value.
Some useful, and perhaps not obvious, features of the current library include:
- Interval (and its "concrete" subclass) which can be used for any
objects that implement Comparable. For example, Money implements Comparable. So
if you want to check Price ranges, make an interval for each Money range. Any
class of yours which implements Comparable can have logical intervals defined
this way.


Usage Examples
---------------
Release 0.2.1 introduces the first usage examples (more to come).
These are meant to be illustrations of how the library might be
used in an application. They are executable code and are included
in AllTests. See example.insuranceRates package.


Java Version Requirement: 1.4
-----------------------------
Currency:  The money package depends on the java.util.Currency class. This dependency
could be eliminated by adding a Currency class to the library. For now, it seems
simpler to use what the Sun provided.

assert: Many methods state preconditions using Java assert statement, which is ignored,
by default, in 1.4, but will not compile in earlier Java versions. This can be made 
backward compatible by commenting out the assert statements.
To use the code as-is, all the compiler compliance options must be set to 1.4.
